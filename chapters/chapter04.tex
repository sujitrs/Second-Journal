%\section{Objectives}
In Self Sovereign Identity(SSI), the different stakeholders - issuer, holder, verifier; each will have important role to play. Unless a complete solution that encompasses all the principles of SSI and at the same time its open for usage/adaptation there will not be any large implementations of the same. SSI is built from perspective of public digital good and hence it needs to be supported.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Study current implementations of W3C DID, W3C VC - JOLOCOM, Tykn, Sovereign.org.
    \item Suggest scope of improvement
    \item Create set of open protocols 
\end{itemize}
