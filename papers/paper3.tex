    In \cite{9146840}, Decentralised Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials specifications are mentioned by W3C; but implementation is left open. This paper implements it using Information Centric Network (ICN). It has detailed implementation concepts. The use of this technology entails some additional overhead, including increased communication and computation overhead, storage overhead, and in many cases monetary costs.
