    In \cite{9225878}, Credential signature data model based on a Merkle tree is being proposed instead of open badge Credentials A method to verify a digital learning credential using blockchain and an abstract signature model built on top of a binary Merkle tree. The method allows a recipient to partially disclose information regarding to the obtained credential to a verifier. Such ability allows for anonymous credential verification, and partial disclosure of evidence supporting the fulfillment of the obtained credential. Dependency and relationship between such evidences and the credential can also be verified.
